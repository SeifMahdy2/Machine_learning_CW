Cap Diameter: The measurement of the cap across its widest point. It helps in identifying the mushroomâ€™s size and can range from a few millimeters to several centimeters.

Cap Shape: The overall shape of the cap, such as conical, bell-shaped, flat, or wavy. This characteristic helps in distinguishing different species.

Cap Color: The color of the cap, which can vary widely and may change as the mushroom matures. Color can be a key factor in identifying species.

Does Bruise or Bleed: Refers to whether the mushroom changes color when bruised or if it releases a colored liquid. This reaction can be important for identification.

Gill Color: The color of the gills, which can help in distinguishing species and may change with age.

Stem Height: The length of the stem from the ground to where the cap is attached. Variations in stem height can aid in identification.

Stem Width: The diameter of the stem. It can be narrow, medium, or wide, and varies among species.

Stem Color: The color of the stem, which might be uniform or vary along its length.

Has Ring: Indicates whether the mushroom has a ring (also called an annulus) around the stem, which is a remnant of the partial veil.

Habitat: The environment where the mushroom is found, such as woodlands, grasslands, or urban areas. The habitat can help narrow down the possible species.

Season: The time of year when the mushroom appears. Different species fruit in different seasons, which helps in identification.
